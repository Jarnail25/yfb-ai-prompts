# Training Methodology — GROUND TRUTH

This document is the authoritative reference for all plan generation. All prompts and generated plans MUST conform to the principles described here. If any other document contradicts this one, this document takes precedence.

## 1. Periodization Model

### Macrocycle Structure
Three-phase macrocycle across 8-12 weeks (duration adjusted based on user experience and goals):

| Phase | Name | Duration | Focus | Intensity | Volume |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation | 3-4 weeks | Movement quality, work capacity, tissue preparation | Moderate (RPE 6-7) | Moderate-high (3-4 sets, 10-15 reps) |
| 2 | Accumulation | 3-4 weeks | Hypertrophy, strength-endurance, progressive overload | Moderate-high (RPE 7-8) | High (4-5 sets, 6-12 reps) |
| 3 | Realization | 2-4 weeks | Peak strength, power expression, sport transfer | High (RPE 8-9) | Lower (3-4 sets, 3-6 reps) |

### Deload Protocol
- Every 4th week is a deload week
- Volume reduced by 40-50% (reduce sets, not exercises)
- Intensity reduced to RPE 5-6
- Maintain movement patterns and frequency
- Deload applies within each phase (e.g., Phase 1: Week 1, 2, 3, Deload, then Phase 2 begins)

### Phase Transitions
- Progression between phases is automatic (not performance-gated for MVP)
- If user experience_level is "beginner", extend Phase 1 to 4 weeks
- If user experience_level is "advanced", Phase 1 can be 2-3 weeks

## 2. Session Structure

### Full-Body Sessions
All sessions are full-body, using an A/B/C/D block format within each session:

| Block | Name | Purpose | Typical Duration |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| A | Primary Strength | Main compound lift for the session's movement plane | 15-20 min |
| B | Secondary + Rotation | Supporting compound + rotational/frontal plane work | 15-20 min |
| C | Isometric + End-Range | Tissue resilience, joint health, mobility under load | 10-15 min |
| D | Core Circuit | Anti-movement patterns progressing to dynamic/reactive | 5-10 min |

### Block Execution
- Block A: Straight sets with full rest (90-180s). Primary lift of the day.
- Block B: Supersets or alternating sets (60-90s rest). Secondary compound paired with rotational or lateral movement.
- Block C: Supersets with minimal rest (30-60s). Isometric holds paired with end-range training.
- Block D: Circuit format (20-30s rest between exercises, 60s between rounds). 2-3 core exercises for 2-3 rounds.

### Warm-Up Protocol (Cressey-Influenced)
Every session begins with a structured warm-up (not counted in Block A-D time):

1. **Foam Rolling** (3-5 min) — Target areas based on user's tight areas from quiz (hip flexors, thoracic spine, lats, glutes, calves). 30-60s per area.
2. **Movement Prep** (5-7 min) — Dynamic stretches and activation drills specific to the session's movement patterns. Include hip flexor stretches for desk workers.
3. **Neural Activation** (2-3 min) — Explosive/plyometric primers at low volume (e.g., box jumps x3, med ball slams x5, band pull-aparts x10). Prepares the nervous system for heavy loading.

## 3. Session Rotation

Three session types performed weekly, each emphasizing a different movement plane:

| Session | Plane Emphasis | Block A Example | Block B Example |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| A | Sagittal (forward/back) | Front-loaded squat variation, hip hinge | Horizontal push/pull, lunges |
| B | Frontal/Rotational (lateral/twisting) | Lateral lunge, landmine press | Cable rotation, single-arm row |
| C | Posterior Chain (hip-dominant) | Romanian deadlift, hip thrust | Nordic curls, pull-up variations |

### Weekly Templates by Frequency

| Sessions/Week | Schedule |
|---------------|----------|
| 2 | A, C (alternate B next week) |
| 3 | A, B, C |
| 4 | A, B, C, A (rotate: next week B, C, A, B) |
| 5 | A, B, C, A, B (rotate weekly) |
| 6 | A, B, C, A, B, C |

All three session types (A, B, C) MUST appear at least once per week when frequency ≥ 3.

## 4. Movement Ratios and Priorities

### Pull-to-Push Ratio
- **Minimum 3:2** across all sessions combined
- Measured by total sets: if 10 push sets in a week, need ≥ 15 pull sets
- Pull includes: rows, pull-ups, face pulls, band pull-aparts, reverse flies
- Push includes: presses (bench, overhead, landmine), push-ups, dips
- This ratio is NON-NEGOTIABLE. It addresses the postural imbalance most users have (especially desk workers)

### Lower Body Priority
- **Lunge/split-squat dominant** — no heavy bilateral back squats as default
- Rationale: joint health, single-leg stability, real-world transfer, reduced spinal load
- Acceptable bilateral lower body: front squats, goblet squats, trap bar deadlifts, hip thrusts, Romanian deadlifts
- Back squats ONLY if: user is advanced, has no back/knee issues, and specifically requests or needs them for sport
- Bulgarian split squats, reverse lunges, walking lunges, and lateral lunges are primary lower body movements

## 5. Progressive Components

### Isometric Progression (Block C)
Progresses across phases:

| Phase | Isometric Type | Example | Duration/Protocol |
|-------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| Foundation | Yielding (hold position) | Wall sit, dead hang, split squat iso hold | 20-45s holds, 2-3 sets |
| Accumulation | Overcoming (push against immovable) | Iso pull-up hold at 90°, iso push-up at bottom | 6-10s max effort, 3-4 sets |
| Realization | Functional/Reactive | Iso lunge → explosive step-up, iso row → band speed row | 5s hold → explosive rep, 3 sets |

### End-Range Training Progression (Block C)
Progresses across phases:

| Phase | End-Range Type | Example | Protocol |
|-------|---------------|---------|----------|
| Foundation | PAILs/RAILs | 90/90 hip PAILs/RAILs, shoulder sleeper stretch | 2 min stretch → 10s contract each direction, 2-3 sets |
| Accumulation | Loaded Stretches | DB fly at bottom, Romanian deadlift pause at bottom | 3-5s hold at end range under load, 3 sets |
| Realization | Dynamic End-Range | Overhead squat, Turkish get-up, full-depth pause snatch-grip DL | Full ROM with load, controlled tempo, 2-3 sets |

### Core Progression (Block D)
Progresses across phases:

| Phase | Core Focus | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Foundation | Anti-movement (stability) | Dead bugs, Pallof press, plank variations, bird dogs |
| Accumulation | Loaded rotational | Cable woodchops, landmine rotations, weighted carries |
| Realization | Explosive/reactive | Med ball slams, rotational throws, hanging leg raises |

### Nordic Curl Progression
Programmed in EVERY session across all phases:

| Phase | Nordic Variation | Sets x Reps |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Foundation | Eccentric-only (slow lower, assist back up) | 3 x 4-6 (5s eccentric) |
| Accumulation | Full range (eccentric + concentric) | 3 x 6-8 |
| Realization | Reactive (speed eccentrics, band-assisted plyometric) | 3 x 4-6 |

If user has hamstring/knee injury: follow injury protocol modifications instead.

## 6. Tempo and RPE Guidelines

### Tempo Notation
Format: Eccentric-Pause-Concentric-Pause (e.g., 3-1-1-0)

| Phase | Default Tempo | Exception |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Foundation | 3-1-2-0 (controlled, learning movement) | Isometrics use hold times instead |
| Accumulation | 3-0-1-0 (controlled eccentric, normal concentric) | Power movements: 2-0-X-0 (X = explosive) |
| Realization | 2-0-X-0 (fast eccentric, explosive concentric) | Max strength: 3-1-1-1 (controlled with pauses) |

### RPE Targets by Phase

| Phase | Working Sets RPE | Deload RPE |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| Foundation | 6-7 | 4-5 |
| Accumulation | 7-8 | 5-6 |
| Realization | 8-9 | 5-6 |

---

## 7. Rest Periods

| Block | Default Rest | Phase Adjustment |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| A (Primary) | 120-180s | Foundation: 120s, Accumulation: 150s, Realization: 180s |
| B (Secondary) | 60-90s | Between superset pairs |
| C (Isometric/End-Range) | 30-60s | Between superset pairs |
| D (Core Circuit) | 20-30s between exercises | 60s between rounds |

---

## 8. Session Duration Targets

Plans MUST fit within the user's stated session duration:

| User Preference | Warm-up | Blocks A-D | Total |
|----------------|---------|------------|-------|
| 30 min | 5 min (abbreviated) | 25 min (reduce to 3 blocks) | 30 min |
| 45 min | 8 min | 37 min | 45 min |
| 60 min | 10 min | 50 min | 60 min |
| 75 min | 12 min | 63 min | 75 min |
| 90+ min | 15 min (full protocol) | 75 min (add accessory work) | 90 min |

For 30-minute sessions: drop Block C (isometrics/end-range) and abbreviate Block D to 1 core exercise. Maintain Block A and Block B as priority.
