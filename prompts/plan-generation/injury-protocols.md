# Injury Protocols

Injury-specific modifications, substitutions, and contraindicated movements. When the user's quiz profile flags any injury, pain, or limitation, the plan generation AI MUST apply the corresponding protocol below.

**Safety principle:** When in doubt, choose the more conservative option. A safe plan that progresses slowly is always better than an aggressive plan that causes re-injury.

## 1. General Rules

### Severity Scale (from quiz)
| Pain Level | Classification | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 1-3 | Mild | Modify exercise selection, add warm-up focus, monitor |
| 4-6 | Moderate | Substitute aggravating movements, reduce load/ROM, extend Phase 1 |
| 7-10 | Severe | Avoid the affected movement pattern entirely, focus on surrounding areas, recommend physiotherapy |

### Medical Override
If the user reports:
- Currently working with a physiotherapist → Include note: "Consult your physiotherapist before starting this program"
- Told to avoid specific movements → Those movements are ABSOLUTELY CONTRAINDICATED — no exceptions, no progressions toward them
- Post-surgery (< 6 months) → Extend Phase 1 by 2 weeks, reduce all RPE targets by 1, no loaded end-range work on affected area

### General Injury Warm-Up Addition
For any flagged injury area, add 2-3 minutes of targeted warm-up:
- Gentle mobilization of the affected joint
- Activation of surrounding stabilizers
- Pain-free range-of-motion exploration

## 2. Knee Protocols

### ACL (Injury or Post-Surgery)

**Contraindicated:**
- Deep jump landings (high impact)
- Rapid deceleration drills (until Phase 3 and pain-free)
- Heavy bilateral back squat (excessive shear force)
- Open-chain knee extension at full ROM under heavy load

**Modified:**
- Squats: limit depth to 90° until Phase 2, then progress gradually
- Lunges: reverse lunges preferred over forward lunges (less shear)
- Plyometrics: only in Phase 3, start with low-box step-downs
- Nordic curls: MAINTAIN (critical for ACL prehab/rehab) but start eccentric-only with band assist regardless of experience level

**Required additions:**
- Terminal knee extensions (TKEs) with band in every warm-up
- Single-leg balance work in every warm-up
- VMO activation (wall sit with ball squeeze) in Block C

### MCL / LCL (Medial or Lateral Collateral)

**Contraindicated:**
- Lateral lunges and Cossack squats (MCL stress)
- Wide-stance squats and sumo deadlifts (MCL stress)
- Valgus-loading movements

**Modified:**
- Session B (frontal plane): replace lateral movements with rotational movements only
- Single-leg work: sagittal plane only until pain-free in frontal plane
- Progress lateral work gradually in Phase 2 if pain < 2/10

### Meniscus

**Contraindicated:**
- Deep squats beyond 90° (unless pain-free and post-rehab confirmed)
- Heavy loaded twisting under compression (e.g., barbell curtsy lunge)

**Modified:**
- All squat variations: box squat to parallel or above
- Reduce knee-over-toe positions; emphasize hip hinge patterns
- Leg press (if available) at moderate depth as alternative

### Patellofemoral (Runner's Knee / Anterior Knee Pain)

**Contraindicated:**
- Deep knee flexion under load
- Excessive downhill walking/running
- Heavy step-ups (especially high box)

**Modified:**
- Limit knee flexion to pain-free range
- Isometric wall sits at pain-free angle (often 30-60°)
- Prioritize hip strengthening (glute med, hip external rotation) — weak hips are a common driver
- Spanish squats with band if available (decompresses patellofemoral joint)

**Required additions:**
- Glute med activation in every warm-up (banded clamshells, side-lying abduction)
- Quad foam rolling (avoid rolling directly over patella)

---

## 3. Shoulder Protocols

### General Shoulder Pain / Impingement

**Contraindicated:**
- Upright rows
- Behind-the-neck press
- Dips (if pain > 3/10)
- Wide-grip bench press
- Overhead press at full lockout (if impingement)

**Modified:**
- Bench press: neutral grip DB press or floor press (limits ROM)
- Overhead press: landmine press (angled, less impingement risk)
- Lateral raises: below 90° or scaption (30° forward of lateral plane)
- Pull-ups: neutral grip, stop before chin-over-bar if painful

**Required additions:**
- Band pull-aparts and face pulls in EVERY session warm-up (minimum 2 sets x 15)
- External rotation work (band or light DB) in warm-up
- Thoracic extension mobility in warm-up

### Rotator Cuff (Tear, Strain, Post-Surgery)

**Contraindicated (until cleared):**
- All overhead pressing
- Heavy horizontal pressing
- Loaded internal rotation
- Plyometric upper body (clap push-ups, etc.)

**Modified:**
- Phase 1: isometric shoulder holds only (no dynamic loading)
- Phase 2: light pressing in pain-free ranges, emphasis on pulling
- Phase 3: gradually reintroduce overhead work if pain-free
- Push:pull ratio inverted to 2:3 (more pulling) until full recovery

**Required additions:**
- Rotator cuff activation sequence in every warm-up (ER/IR with band, YTWL)
- Scapular stability work (wall slides, serratus push-ups)

---

## 4. Lower Back Protocols

### General Lower Back Pain

**Contraindicated:**
- Heavy conventional deadlifts from floor
- Loaded spinal flexion (weighted crunches, sit-ups)
- Good mornings with heavy load
- Rapid rotational movements under load

**Modified:**
- Deadlifts: trap bar (elevated handles), rack pulls, or Romanian deadlift only
- Squats: goblet squat or front squat (forces upright torso)
- Core work: anti-extension and anti-rotation ONLY (no crunches, no sit-ups)
- Rows: supported rows (chest-supported DB row, seal row) to reduce spinal load

**Required additions:**
- Cat-cow and bird dogs in every warm-up
- McGill Big 3 (curl-up, side plank, bird dog) in Phase 1 Block D
- Hip flexor stretching in every warm-up (tight hip flexors contribute to back pain)

### Disc Issues (Herniation, Bulge)

**Contraindicated:**
- ALL loaded spinal flexion
- Sit-ups, crunches, toe touches
- Heavy bilateral deadlifts
- Rounded-back positions under load

**Modified:**
- Maintain neutral spine in ALL exercises — add coaching cue to every movement
- Prefer standing and half-kneeling positions over seated
- Reduce axial loading (less barbell back work, more unilateral DB work)
- Hip hinge: single-leg RDL or cable pull-through (lighter load, less compression)

### Post-Surgery (Spinal)

- Phase 1: 4 weeks minimum, RPE never exceeds 5
- No axial loading until Phase 2
- All movements start bodyweight, progress to light DB only
- Require medical clearance note in plan output

## 5. Hip Protocols

### General Hip Pain / FAI (Femoroacetabular Impingement)

**Contraindicated:**
- Deep squats (below 90° hip flexion)
- Sumo stance movements
- Aggressive hip flexor stretching (may worsen FAI)

**Modified:**
- Squat depth: to pain-free range (often parallel or above)
- Hip hinge: prioritize over squat patterns
- Lunges: reverse only, moderate stride length
- Avoid adductor-heavy movements (adductor squeeze, Copenhagen plank)

**Required additions:**
- Glute activation in every warm-up
- Hip controlled articular rotations (CARs) in warm-up
- Supine 90/90 breathing drill

---

## 6. Ankle/Foot Protocols

### Ankle Instability / Sprain History

**Contraindicated:**
- Single-leg plyometrics (until Phase 3 and pain-free)
- Uneven surface training without progression

**Modified:**
- All single-leg work: start with hand support available
- Calf work: bilateral before unilateral
- Balance work: flat surface → foam pad → eyes closed (progressive)

**Required additions:**
- Ankle CARs in every warm-up
- Band ankle inversions/eversions (2 x 15 each direction)
- Calf-specific foam rolling

---

## 7. Neck / Upper Back Protocols

### Neck Pain / Stiffness

**Contraindicated:**
- Behind-the-neck press or pull-down
- Heavy shrugs
- Loaded neck extension

**Modified:**
- All overhead work: ensure thoracic mobility allows overhead position without neck compensation
- Reduce trap-dominant exercises; prioritize lower/mid trap
- Farmers walks: moderate load only (excessive trap load aggravates neck)

**Required additions:**
- Cervical CARs (controlled articular rotations) in warm-up
- Chin tucks (2 x 10) in warm-up
- Thoracic extension over foam roller

---

## 8. Elbow / Wrist Protocols

### Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis)

**Modified:**
- Grip-intensive exercises: reduce load or use straps
- Pull-ups: neutral grip, consider assisted
- Curls: hammer grip only (neutral wrist)
- Rows: use straps to reduce grip demand

**Required additions:**
- Eccentric wrist extensions with light DB (3 x 15) post-session
- Forearm foam rolling

### Wrist Pain

**Modified:**
- Push-ups: on fists or push-up handles (neutral wrist)
- Front squats: cross-arm grip instead of clean grip
- All pressing: neutral/hammer grip DB preferred over straight bar

## 9. Multiple Injuries

When a user has 2+ injuries:
1. Apply ALL relevant protocols simultaneously
2. If protocols conflict (e.g., knee protocol says more hip hinge, but hip protocol limits hip flexion), use the MORE CONSERVATIVE option
3. Extend Phase 1 by at least 1 week per additional injury
4. Reduce total exercise count per session by 1-2 (fewer exercises, better execution)
5. Add a plan-level note: "This plan accounts for multiple limitations. Progress conservatively and stop any exercise that causes pain > 3/10."

## 10. Movement Screening Proxy Adjustments

Based on quiz Category 10 (mobility self-assessment):

| Test | Fail Condition | Adjustment |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Toe touch | "Not close" | Add hamstring mobility in every warm-up, Romanian DL with reduced ROM, no conventional deadlifts |
| Deep squat hold | "Can't get there" | Elevated heel squat, goblet squat to box, ankle mobility in warm-up |
| Arms overhead | "Restricted" | No overhead pressing until Phase 2, landmine press instead, thoracic mobility in every warm-up |
| Single-leg balance | "Can't do it" | Balance work in every warm-up, single-leg exercises start with hand support |
| Tight areas (any) | Selected areas | Add targeted foam rolling + mobility for each selected area in warm-up |
