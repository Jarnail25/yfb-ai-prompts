## Purpose

This document defines the block structure used in every generated training plan. The AI plan generation engine MUST produce sessions following this taxonomy. This is the authoritative reference — if any other document contradicts this, this document wins.

## Standard Session Structure (Sessions A, B, C)

Every standard session (A, B, C) contains 6 blocks executed in order. Total session time: 70-85 minutes.

### A Block: Primary Strength (15-18 min)
- **Purpose:** Main compound lift + primary antagonist pairing
- **Exercise count:** 2 exercises (A1, A2) — always superset
- **Phase 1:** 3 sets × 8-10 reps, 3-4s eccentrics, RPE 7
- **Phase 2:** 4 sets × 4-6 reps, heavy loads, RPE 8-9
- **Phase 3:** 3 sets × 3-4 reps + explosive contrast pair (A1 heavy → A2 explosive), RPE 8-9
- **Rest:** 90s (P1), 2 min (P2), 60-90s between contrast pairs (P3)
- **Selection rules:**
  - Session A: Squat-pattern (BSS, Cossack) + Vertical Pull (Pull-up)
  - Session B: Lateral squat-pattern (Cossack, Lateral Lunge) + Horizontal Pull (Row)
  - Session C: Hip hinge (Hex Bar DL, RDL) + Overhead Press

### B Block: Secondary Strength + Rotation (12-15 min)
- **Purpose:** Secondary compound movements, rotational work, and knee prehab
- **Exercise count:** 3 exercises (B1, B2, B3)
- **Phase 1:** 3 sets × 6-12 reps, controlled tempos, RPE 7-8
- **Phase 2:** 3-4 sets × 5-8 reps, heavier loads, RPE 8-9
- **Phase 3:** 3 sets × 3-6 reps, explosive intent, RPE 8-9
- **Rest:** 60s (P1), 90s (P2), 60-90s (P3)
- **Mandatory inclusions:**
  - Nordic curl variant in EVERY session's B Block (B1 position). Non-negotiable — ACL prehab.
  - Rotational exercise in B3 position (Pallof, Woodchop, Landmine Rotation, Med Ball)
  - Pressing movement in B2 (Incline DB, Floor Press, Ring Dip, Explosive Push-up)

### C Block: Isometric + End-Range Training (10-12 min)
- **Purpose:** Active flexibility, isometric strength at end-range, mobility maintenance
- **Exercise count:** 3-4 exercises (C1-C4)
- **Phase 1:** PAILs/RAILs, long isometric holds (45-60s), ring-assisted progressions, RPE 6-7
- **Phase 2:** Loaded stretches, overcoming isometrics (8s max effort), reduced ring assist, RPE 7-9
- **Phase 3:** Dynamic end-range, reactive stability, maintenance holds, RPE 7-8
- **Rest:** 30-45s
- **Progression rules (HARD CONSTRAINTS):**
  - Isometric type: Yielding (P1) → Overcoming (P2) → Reactive (P3)
  - End-range: Passive stretches (P1) → Loaded stretches (P2) → Dynamic end-range (P3)
  - Pistol squat progression tracks across all 12 weeks in C Block

### D Block: Core Circuit (8-10 min)
- **Purpose:** Anti-movement, rotational, and sport-specific core training
- **Exercise count:** 3-4 exercises (D1-D4)
- **Phase 1:** Anti-movement (Dead Bug, Side Plank, Pallof), isometric neck, RPE 6-7
- **Phase 2:** Loaded core (Ab Wheel, Copenhagen Plank, TGU, weighted carries), dynamic neck, RPE 7-8
- **Phase 3:** Explosive core (Hanging Raises, Med Ball Slams, dynamic planks), heavy neck, RPE 8-9
- **Rest:** 20-30s (circuit style)
- **Mandatory inclusions:**
  - Neck strengthening in D4 position EVERY session
  - Anti-rotation or rotation exercise in D1 position
  - Back extension variant in D3 position (spinal extensors)

### E Block: Hypertrophy (8-10 min)
- **Purpose:** Joint protection, aesthetic development, work capacity for accessory muscles
- **Exercise count:** 2-3 exercises (E1-E3)
- **Phase 1:** 2 sets × 12-15 reps, light-moderate, mind-muscle connection, RPE 7
- **Phase 2:** 3 sets × 10-12 reps, moderate-heavy, closer to failure, RPE 8
- **Phase 3:** 2 sets × 8-12 reps, drop sets/supersets, RPE 8-9
- **Rest:** 45s
- **Session-specific selection (varies by session, NOT repeated):**
  - Session A E-Block: Biceps, Lateral Raise, Quad accessory
  - Session B E-Block: Triceps, Rear Delt, Traps
  - Session C E-Block: Rows (high rep), Glutes (hip thrust), Lats (pullover/pulldown)
  - Session D E-Block: Combo movements (Curl+Press), Band Pull-Aparts

### F Block: Accessory — Tendon Health & Grip (8-10 min)
- **Purpose:** Daily-trainable muscle groups for tendon resilience, ankle stability, grip strength
- **Exercise count:** 2 exercises per session (NOT 4 in every session)
- **Rest:** 30s
- **CRITICAL DISTRIBUTION RULE (the F-Block Fix):**
  - Session A (sagittal/lower emphasis): F1. Calf Raise + F2. Tibialis Raise
  - Session B (frontal/upper emphasis): F1. Dead Hang + F2. Wrist Roller
  - Session C (posterior/hinge emphasis): F1. Calf Raise + F2. Tibialis Raise
  - Session D (sport-specific): F1. Dead Hang + F2. Wrist Roller (or full 4 if time allows)
- **Phase progression:**
  - P1: BW, slow eccentrics, 2×12-15 reps, RPE 6-7
  - P2: Banded/weighted, 2×10-12 reps, RPE 7-8
  - P3: Heavy/explosive, 2×8-10 + isometric holds, RPE 8
- **Rationale:** Calf/tibialis and grip/hang are both daily-trainable but programming all 4 in every session adds 8 unnecessary sets. Distribution ensures 2x/week frequency for each pair while keeping sessions efficient.

## Session D: Sport-Specific Integration (UNIQUE STRUCTURE)

Session D does NOT follow the standard A-F block template. It has a unique structure per phase because its purpose changes across the macrocycle.

### Session D — Phase 1: Movement Practice & Foundation
- A Block: Movement Practice (Lunge Matrix, Light TGU)
- B Block: Plyometric Intro (Low Box Jumps, Med Ball Chest Pass)
- C Block: Mobility Flow (90/90 Hip Switch, World's Greatest Stretch, Y-T-W)
- D Block: Sport-Specific Core (Med Ball Rotational, Plank Shoulder Taps, SL Balance)
- E Block: Light Hypertrophy (Curls, Lateral Raises — 2 exercises only)
- F Block: Accessory (Dead Hang + Wrist Roller)

### Session D — Phase 2: Power Development & Heavy Singles
- A Block: Heavy Singles/Doubles Practice (Hex Bar DL 5×2-3, Weighted Pull-Up 4×2-3)
- B Block: Power Development (Depth Jump, Med Ball Slam)
- C Block: Active Recovery Mobility (90/90 PAILs/RAILs, Deep Squat Hold, Couch Stretch)
- D Block: Combat/Sport Core (Rotational Med Ball Series, Plank to Push-Up, Neck Circuit)
- E Block: Moderate Hypertrophy (Hammer Curl, Face Pull — 2 exercises only)
- F Block: Accessory (Calf Raise + Tibialis Raise)

### Session D — Phase 3: Peak Testing & Sport Simulation
- A Block: Peak Power Testing (Hex Bar DL 1-3RM test, Max Pull-Up Test)
- B Block: Sport Simulation (Multi-Directional Plyometric Circuit, KB Snatch)
- C Block: Mobility Maintenance (Full Body CARs, World's Greatest Stretch, Pistol Squat Test)
- D Block: Final Core Power (Med Ball Complex, L-Sit Hold, Peak Neck Loading)
- E Block: Maintenance Hypertrophy (Curl+Press Combo, Band Pull-Aparts — 2 exercises only)
- F Block: Accessory (Dead Hang + Wrist Roller)

## Session Emphasis Reference

| Session | Movement Plane | A Block Pattern | Key Differentiator |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| A | Sagittal | Squat + Vertical Pull | BSS/Squat + Pull-Up |
| B | Frontal/Rotational | Lateral Squat + Horizontal Pull | Cossack + Row |
| C | Posterior Chain | Hip Hinge + Overhead Press | Deadlift + OHP |
| D | Sport-Specific | Varies by phase | Unique structure per phase |

## Pull-to-Push Ratio Enforcement

Minimum 3:2 across every session. Count method:
- **Pull exercises:** Pull-ups, Rows, Face Pulls, Band Pull-Aparts, Gorilla Rows, DB Rows, Seal Rows
- **Push exercises:** Presses (Incline, Floor, Overhead, Push-Up variants), Dips
- Every session must have at least 3 pulling movements for every 2 pushing movements
- The AI MUST count and verify this ratio before finalizing any generated session
